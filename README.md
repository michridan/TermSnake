# TermSnake

I just wanted to make an ascii snake game to be run in the terminal, let's see how this goes.

**Note: Closing this indefinitely, turns out event-driven programs using only ncurses is pretty hard, gotta do more research first**

## Goals

1. ~~Learn how to manipulate the terminal screen using the ncurses library~~
2. Learn how to make a program universally executable in the terminal
3. Learn how to make the program installable to other systems
4. And, y'know, make a snake game
