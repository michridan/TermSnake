# TermSnake

A recreation of the classic Snake game for the Linux terminal.

Being developed in Linux Mint, with future plans to make it as universally portable as possible.

## Plans for 2.0:

1. Refactor code, separate game from underlying implementation

2. Add score display/high score system

3. MAKE GITIGNORE

4. Add gameover screen/replay option
