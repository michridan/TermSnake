# TermSnake

I just wanted to make an ascii snake game to be run in the terminal, **let's see how this goes**.

## Goals

1. Learn how to manipulate the terminal screen
2. Learn how to make a program universally executable in the terminal
3. Learn how to make the program installable to other systems
4. And, y'know, make a snake game
